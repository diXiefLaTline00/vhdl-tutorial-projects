vhdl notes: 

    - vhdl constant: '0' or '1' bit value
    - vhdl assignment operator Q <= A and B


basics of fpga: 
    - made up of two main components: block ram & logic elements
    - logic elements: 
        3 multiplexers
        look up table 
        flipflop

- a LUT as N inputs, 1 output
- LUTs are used to emulate logic gates

- flipflop: stores input at the rising or falling edge of a clock signal, basic element or memory, outputs input
    - inputs to a fliplop: 
        - D: data input
        - EN: enable input, locks last value, 1 => flipflop is running
        - '-|>' symbol is the clock input
        - SR: reset will set output to 0 on the next rising edge
        - Q: sample and holds the data input at the rising edge of the clock

- fpga synthesis: place & route
    - vendor specific toolchain
    - generic VHDL code will not match to logic primitives, so we structure our vhdl code to match these primitives
    - chain: 
        synthesis
            takes as an input your vhdl code 
        place and route
            uses unrouted netlist and constraints file
        generate bitmap
            bitfile which programs the fpga
